## How to use:

- Double-click the BobLite jar file. That will open the Project Selector
- Create a new project, select it and click `Open Project`
- Choose one or more replay files to edit.
- After that, it should be pretty straight forward. The time is in ticks, like the `/time set` command
- Finally, a new file chooser will appear. Select your drive with the most storage space. That will be where the temporary file will be created.

Once bob is done working on your replay, it'll open a file explorer. You can now copy the replay and paste it in the `.minecraft/replay_recordings/` folder

## Note:

Bob works on a copy of your replay, not one the original one.

Projects can be found in the following folder:
- Windows: `%userprofile%\.bob\projects\`
- *nix: `~/.bob/projects/`
